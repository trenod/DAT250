## Technical problems that you encountered during the completion of the tutorial

There was a problem with the first spring boot tutorial where when I tried to run it, it showed an error message. I searched the web and discovered that it was commonly related to having a space somewhere in the directory structure. In my case it was having parantheses in the folder name, so I removed those and it worked.

Another problem was with spring boot in the second experiment. Neither gradle or maven completed running, and I couldn't load the web page on localhost. I had basically completed the tutorial at this point, so I moved on to the next and made sure to enable everything that IntelliJ suggested. At this point spring boot worked perfectly, so as I did everything the same I assume this was the error.

## Any pending issues with this assignment which you did not manage to solve

The issue with the second experiment has not been fully resolved, but as I got spring boot to work properly later on I don't believe it will be an issue going forward.
