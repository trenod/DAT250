## Technical problems that you encountered during the completion of the tutorial

At first when I was going to run the files in the tutorial, I used the 
instructions for using the jar whiles and run things from the command line. 
I had some problems doing that, that might be related to using Windows or IntelliJ.
As soon as I started to simply run every file's Main method using the IntelliJ GUI, 
I had no further problems.

## Any pending issues with this assignment which you did not manage to solve

There are no pending issues as far as I'm aware. Everything seemed to run
and work as it should.
