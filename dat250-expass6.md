## Technical problems that you encountered during the completion of the tutorial

I encountered no major technical problems, although Angular was quite technical to get into as a technology, which made it hard to get started on the actual coding.

## A link to your code for experiments 1-3 above

* Experiment 1: https://github.com/trenod/gs-serving-web-content

* Experiment 2: https://github.com/trenod/dat250-sparkjava-counter-angular

## Any pending issues with this assignment which you did not manage to solve

I didn't really get started with the coding of Experiment 2 until the day of the deadline, so I haven't yet finished it.
