## Technical problems that you encountered during the completion of the tutorial

I encountered no major technical problems, although Angular was quite technical to get into as a technology, which made it hard to get started on the actual coding.

## Any pending issues with this assignment which you did not manage to solve

The code doesn't do what it should, but it's mostly implemented and should work with some minor tweaks.
